## Water Treatment Plant Automation using PLC & SCADA

**Introduction:**  
Efficient management of precious water resources is paramount for progress. This project explores the convergence of intelligence and automation in water treatment plants through Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The goal is to achieve a delicate balance between purity and sustainability, revolutionizing water treatment processes with precision and control.

**Project Spotlight:**  
The project showcases the seamless fusion of physical and software elements, offering an immersive learning experience in water purification complexity.

**Representation of the System:**  
Drawing inspiration from real plants and water purification books, the project faithfully replicates water treatment phases to demonstrate the usual methods employed in treating water. The system includes components such as water intakes, chemical injections, flocculation, coagulation, sedimentation, clarifier, and filtration.

**Water Intake:**  
Simulating water intake through a tank representing raw water containment and a water pump to propel water throughout the replica. A water detection sensor ensures pump protection and alerts users about water levels.

**Chemical Injections:**  
Injection of chlorine and alum, vital for eliminating living organisms and catching non-living objects, respectively. Hanging infusion bags and liquid valves emulate the injection process.

**Flocculation:**  
Imitating the flash mixing process with a glass tank, actuator, and water detection sensor to create a uniform distribution of flocculants.

**Coagulation and Sedimentation:**  
Coagulation represented by a glass tank with a slow mixer and water detection sensor. Sedimentation driven by parallel tubes leading to a tank with an actuator and water valve.

**Clarifier and Filtration:**  
Filtration aims to rid water of plankton, bacteria, and algae, achieved through filter basins. Backwashing process and specific timers ensure optimal filter washing.

**Sludge Tank:**  
Collects unclear water from clarifier and filters after washing. Controlled by water valve and pump, with sensors indicating water levels for proper operation.

**Electrical Components:**  
The project incorporates various electrical components, including PLC, MPI communication cable, power supply, relays, buttons, switches, LED lights, water valves, water pumps, Arduino Uno, water detection sensors, motors, siren, air valves, and air compressor.
